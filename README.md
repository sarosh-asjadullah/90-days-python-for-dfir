# Python for DFIR — 90-Day Apprenticeship

This repository documents a 90-day, exercise-driven journey to build **practical Python proficiency for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**.

The focus is not on learning Python syntax in isolation, but on developing **muscle memory** and **analyst-style thinking** through small, repeatable, real-world tasks.

---

## Philosophy

- One focused task per day  
- Every task produces a **working, reviewable artifact**
- No filler, no copy-paste exercises
- Emphasis on correctness, clarity, and deterministic output
- DFIR mindset from Day 1 (text, logs, artifacts, structure)

This mirrors how DFIR skills are built in practice: incrementally, deliberately, and with attention to detail.

---

## What This Demonstrates

By the end of this series, this repository will show:

- Progressive Python skill development
- Comfort with strings, files, control flow, and data structures
- Ability to translate investigative logic into code
- Consistent delivery and version control discipline
- Practical foundations for DFIR automation and tooling

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 1: The Scripter (Days 1-30) - **In Progress**
- [ ] Phase 2: The Automator (Days 31-60)
- [ ] Phase 3: The Analyst (Days 61-90)

## Learning Log
| Day | Concept | Key Takeaway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Variables & I/O | Variables are containers; inputs are how we ingest artifacts. |
